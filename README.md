# Whisker Drawing Mechanism
## Project Obectives

The purpose of this project is to design a device that manufactures robotic whisker sensors by drawing plastic filament from an oven. It must be able to inspect the diameter of the whisker and adjust the draw speed accordingly to match a specific geometric profile. This process must be quick and repeatable.
