# Whisker Drawing Mechanism
## Project Obectives

The purpose of this project is to design a device that manufactures robotic whisker sensors by drawing polymer plastic filament from an oven. It must be able to inspect the diameter of the whisker and adjust the draw speed accordingly to match a specific geometric profile. This process must be quick and repeatable. 

The image below shows how the shape of the filament develops over time. The heated length of the filament is brought to the plastic's glass transition temperature. Then the filament is pulled away from the oven by the drawing mechanism to created a taper.
